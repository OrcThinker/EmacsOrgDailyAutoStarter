Golang Emacs Day Manager Auto Open development plan:

Thing I want included into the project:
1. Run Emacs on daemon and single instance
    If Emacs daemon in running open emacs 
    If Emacs is running open in the current
    App opens the todays .org file and possibly yesterdays too for comparison

2. Enable automatic execution
    If a project is tagged "automatic open" <- can only be one
    Run the "daily workflow" automatically on windows start

3. Daily workflow expansion
    Only add a new file if there is no file existing for the current date
